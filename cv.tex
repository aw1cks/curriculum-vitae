  \cvSection{About Me}

  \cvParagraph{
    Technical leader bridging infrastructure and software engineering with expertise spanning bare-metal to cloud environments.
    I specialize in Kubernetes, observability, CI/CD, and infrastructure as code, bringing a pragmatic approach to complex problems ---
    whether architecting PKI solutions, writing Kubernetes operators, or optimizing network performance.
    I focus on empowering developers through invisible, reliable infrastructure.
    \\
    Outside of work, I enjoy photography, cars, cooking, and traveling.
