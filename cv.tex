  \cvSection{About Me}

  \cvParagraph{
    Technical leader bridging infrastructure and software engineering. My background spans bare-metal to cloud, with particular expertise in
    Kubernetes, observability, CI/CD and infrastructure as code.
    I'm equally comfortable architecting a PKI solution, writing a Kubernetes operator, or optimizing network performance -- whatever solves the problem at hand.
    I strive to empower developers and make infrastructure invisible to users.
    Outside of work, I enjoy photography, cars, cooking and travelling.
